期刊简介

Molecules (ISSN 1420-3049, CODEN: MOLEFW) is an open access journal of synthetic organic chemistry and natural product chemistry. All articles are peer-reviewed and published continously upon acceptance. Molecules is published by MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Our aim is to encourage chemists to publish as much as possible their experimental detail, particularly synthetic procedures and characterization information. There is no restriction on the length of the experimental section. In addition, availability of compound samples is published and considered as important information. Authors are encouraged to register or deposit their chemical samples through the non-profit international organization Molecular Diversity Preservation International (MDPI). Molecules has been launched in 1996 to preserve and exploit molecular diversity of both, chemical information and chemical substances.
