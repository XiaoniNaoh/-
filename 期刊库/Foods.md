期刊简介

Foods (ISSN 2304-8158) is an international, peer-reviewed scientific open access journal which provides an advanced forum for studies related to all aspects of food research. It publishes reviews, regular research papers and short communications. Our aim is to encourage scientists, researchers, and other food professionals to publish their experimental and theoretical results in as much detail as possible or share their knowledge with as much readers unlimitedly as possible. There is no restriction on the length of the papers. The full experimental details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. There are, in addition, unique features of this journal: ÂŸ manuscripts regarding research proposals and research ideas will be particularly welcomed ÂŸ electronic files or software regarding the full details of the calculation and experimental procedure, if unable to be published in a normal way, can be deposited as supplementary material ÂŸ we also accept manuscripts communicating to a broader audience with regard to research projects financed with public funds
