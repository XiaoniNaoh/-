- ## Abstract

Perilipins (PLINs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that specifically associate with the surface of lipid droplets (LDs). These proteins function in LD biogenesis and lipolysis and help to stabilize the surface of LDs. PLINs are typically composed of three different protein domains. They share an N-terminal PAT domain of unknown structure and function, a central region containing 11-mer repeats that form amphipathic helices, and a C-terminal domain that adopts a 4-helix bundle structure. How exactly these three distinct domains contribute to PLIN function remains to be determined. Here, we show that the N-terminal PAT domain of PLIN3 binds diacylglycerol (DAG), the precursor to triacylglycerol, a major storage lipid of LDs. PLIN3 and its PAT domain alone bind liposomes with micromolar affinity and PLIN3 binds artificial LDs containing low concentrations of DAG with nanomolar affinity. The PAT domain of PLIN3 is predicted to adopt an amphipathic triangular shaped structure. In silico ligand docking indicates that DAG binds to one of the highly curved regions within this domain. A conserved aspartic acid residue in the PAT domain, E86, is predicted to interact with DAG, and we found that its substitution abrogates high affinity binding of DAG as well as DAG-stimulated association with liposome and artificial LDs. These results indicate that the PAT domain of PLINs harbor specific lipid-binding properties that are important for targeting these proteins to the surface of LDs and to ER membrane domains enriched in DAG to promote LD formation.
