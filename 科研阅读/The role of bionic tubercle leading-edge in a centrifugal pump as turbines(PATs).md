- #### Abstract

The structure of the blade's leading edge significantly affects the centrifugal pump as turbines (PATs) performance. This paper has attempted to investigate the hydraulic performance and pressure pulsations characteristics of PATs with bionic tubercle leading edge impellers by numerical calculation and experiment methods. The results showed that the bionic tubercles structure at the leading edge of the blade does not change the PAT's best efficiency point and helps improve the energy recovery efficiency under all operating conditions, especially with efficiency increased by 6.04 % under the over-load operation condition. Moreover, the bionic tubercles structure at the blade's leading edge can improves the impeller's local flow characteristics and effectively reduces the amplitude of dominant frequency in the main domains of PATs. The maximum reduction amplitude of pressure pulsations in the impeller with the bionic tubercle leading-edge under 0.7Qb, Qb, and 1.3Qb operating conditions is 29.8 %, 23.3 % and 61.1 %, respectively. This research provides a reference for the use of bionic blades to improve the energy recovery efficiency and operation stability of PATs.
