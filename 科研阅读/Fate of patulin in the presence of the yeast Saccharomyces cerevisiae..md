- #### Abstract

Patulin is known to become analytically non-detectable during the production of cider from contaminated apple juice. The fate of [14C]-labelled patulin during  the alcoholic fermentation of apple juice was studied. Three commercial cider  strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae degraded patulin during active fermentative  growth, but not when growing aerobically. The products of patulin degradation  were more polar than patulin itself and remained in the clarified fermented  cider. Patulin did not appear to bind to yeast cells or apple juice sediment in  these model experiments. HPLC analysis of patulin-spiked fermentations showed the  appearance of two major metabolites, one of which corresponded by both TLC and  HPLC to E-ascladiol prepared by the chemical reduction of patulin using sodium  borohydride. Using a diode array detector, both metabolites had a lambda(max) =  271 nm, identical to that of ascladiol. The nmr spectrum of a crude preparation  of these metabolites showed signals corresponding to those of the E-ascladiol  prepared chemically and a weaker set of signals corresponding to those reported  in the literature for Z-ascladiol.
