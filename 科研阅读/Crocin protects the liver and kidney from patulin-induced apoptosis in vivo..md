- #### Abstract

Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin mainly produced by Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Bissochlamys. Given the high risk associated with this mycotoxin, its potential  effects have been investigated by many studies. It is known to be teratogenic,  mutagenic, and genotoxic, and it has been shown to induce damages in several  organs in experimental animals. Our aim was to investigate the preventive effect  against PAT-induced apoptosis in vivo using natural carotenoid, Crocin (CRO).  Mice were divided into six groups: a control group, a "PAT alone" group, a "CRO  alone" group, and a "PAT plus CRO" groups (pre-treatment conditions). Our results  showed that CRO restored the normal levels of biochemical parameters in the liver  and kidney. The analysis of the protein expression in these organs revealed that  PAT-induced toxicity promotes the induction of apoptosis via the increase in P53,  Bax, and cytochrome C and the decrease in Bcl2 expressions. We also found that  PAT triggered caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. However, pre-treatment  with CRO demonstrated a reduction in the induction of apoptosis via the  regulation of all tested biomarkers demonstrating that CRO is effective in the  protection against PAT hazards. This could be relevant, particularly with the  emergent demand for natural products which may counteract the detrimental toxic  effects and therefore prevents multiple human diseases.
