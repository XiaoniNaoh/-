##### Abstract
Patulin contamination has become a bottleneck problem in the safe production of fruit products, although biodegradation technology shows potential application value in patulin control. In the present study, the patulin biodegradation mechanism in a probiotic yeast, Pichia guilliermondii S15-8, was investigated. Firstly, the short-chain dehydrogenase PgSDR encoded by gene A5D9S1 was identified as a patulin degradation enzyme, through RNA sequencing and verification by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, the exogenous expression system of the degradation protein PgSDR-A5D9S1 in E. coli was successfully constructed and demonstrated a more significant patulin tolerance and degradation ability. Furthermore, the structure of PgSDR-A5D9S1 and its active binding sites with patulin were predicted via molecular docking analysis. In addition, the heat-excited protein HSF1 was predicted as the transcription factor regulating the patulin degradation protein PgSDR-A5D9S1, which may provide clues for the further analysis of the molecular regulation mechanism of patulin degradation. This study provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the industrial application of biodegradable functional strains.
