- #### Abstract

The mutagenicity of the mycotoxin patulin was assessed by the thymidine kinase mutation assay, which is based on point mutations and deletions. Patulin was mutagenic in cultured mouse lymphoma cells and the mutagenicity was significantly increased in cells pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine, which reduces intracellular glutathione levels.
