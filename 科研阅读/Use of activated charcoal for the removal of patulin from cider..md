- #### Abstract

Penicillium urticae (NRRL 2159A) was grown in culture broth containing 1 muCi of [1-14C-A1acetate to produce [14C]patulin. [14C]patulin was purified from the  broth and added to apple cider. After the patulin concentration of the cider was  adjusted to 30 mug/ml with unlabeled patulin, the cider was subjected to various  charcoal treatments. [14C]patulin was completely removed by shaking the cider  with 20 mg of activated charcoal per ml and by eluting the cider through a 40- to  60-mesh charcoal column. Activated charcola at 5 mg/ml reduced patulin in  naturally contaminated cider to nondetectable levels.
