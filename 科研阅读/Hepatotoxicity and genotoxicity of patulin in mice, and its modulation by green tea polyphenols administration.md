##### Abstract
Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin produced by certain species of Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Byssochlamys. Previous studies demonstrated its cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic effects in different cell lines. However, there is little information available concerning its toxic behavior in vivo. In the present study, we investigated PAT-induced hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity in mice. We also investigated the antioxidant and anti-genotoxicity efficiency of green tea polyphenols (GTP) against PAT-induced toxicity. We found that PAT-treatment induced serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities significantly. PAT-induced lipid peroxidation was confirmed with the elevation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Moreover, the increasing of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing of GSH level implied its oxidative damage mechanism. In bone marrow cell, PAT was found to induce micronucleus and chromosomal aberration formation. In addition, our result suggested that GTP administration has dose-dependent antioxidative and antigenotoxic effect in against PAT-induced hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity.
